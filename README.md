# mortars

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.io/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.io/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our 
[online documentation](https://flutter.io/docs), which offers tutorials, 
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Deployment
Once a month I will need to update Travis' Fastlane Session. I can do this via `fastlane spaceauth -u email@apple.com` and pasting the session into the Travis Repository Settings.
